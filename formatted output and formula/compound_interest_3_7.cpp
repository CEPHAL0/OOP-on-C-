/*Write a program that calculates how much money youâ€™ll end up with if you invest an
amount of money at a fixed interest rate, compounded yearly.Have the user furnish the initial amount,
the number of years, and the yearly interest rate in percent.Some interaction with the
program might look like this :
Enter initial amount : 3000
Enter number of years : 10
Enter interest rate(percent per year) : 5.5
At the end of 10 years, you will have 5124.43 dollars*/

/*At the end of the first year you have 3000 + (3000 * 0.055), which is 3165. At the end of
the second year you have 3165 + (3165 * 0.055), which is 3339.08. Do this as many
times as there are years. A for loop makes the calculation easy.*/
